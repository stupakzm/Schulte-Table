# Schulte-Table Project

This repository contains the code for my Schulte Table game.

![Schulte Table Project](https://github.com/stupakzm/Schulte-Table-Unity/blob/main/Schulte%20Table/Schulte%20Table%20Main.png)

The Schulte Table game is an exciting and challenging game that helps to train attention, concentration and reaction. The main goal of the game is to find and click on the numbers from 1 to 25 (where 25 is the size of the table) in the correct order as quickly as possible.

**Training of attention and concentration:** The game helps to improve the ability to switch attention quickly and maintain concentration for a long time.

**Improved reaction time:** Players develop their reaction time by trying to find and click on the numbers as quickly as possible.

**Personalized settings:** Players can choose a mode (out of six possible) and a table color to customize the game to their needs.

Below is how the *modes* work


* Static - all numbers are in fixed positions.

* Disapear - all numbers are fixed, when you click on the correct one, the position disappears.

* Reverse - as in Static mode, but you need to find the numbers from the end.

* Reaction - all positions are empty except for one (which you need to click as soon as possible) and which is in the opposite color style.

* Dynamic Shuffle - after each click, all numbers change their positions.

* Memory - 3 seconds are given to memorize the grid of numbers, after which the numbers disappear, with the correct press the position disappears. If you press incorrectly, the number is displayed for 3 seconds.
