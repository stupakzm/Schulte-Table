![Schulte Table Project](https://github.com/stupakzm/Schulte-Table-Unity/blob/main/Schulte%20Table/Schulte%20Table%20Main.png)

The Schulte Table game is an exciting and challenging game that helps to train attention, concentration and reaction. The main goal of the game is to find and click on the numbers from 1 to 25 (where 25 is the size of the table) in the correct order as quickly as possible.

**Training of attention and concentration:** The game helps to improve the ability to switch attention quickly and maintain concentration for a long time.

**Improved reaction time:** Players develop their reaction time by trying to find and click on the numbers as quickly as possible.

**Personalized settings:** Players can choose a mode (out of six possible) and a table color to customize the game to their needs.
